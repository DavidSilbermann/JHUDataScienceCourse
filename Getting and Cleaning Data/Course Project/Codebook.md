Mean Body Acceleration, Y Axis - The mean of the tBodyAcc-mean()-Y observations for the subject when preforming the activity.

Mean Body Acceleration, Z Axis - The mean of the tBodyAcc-mean()-Z observations for the subject when preforming the activity.

Standard Deviation of Body Acceleration, X Axis - The mean of the tBodyAcc-std()-X observations for the subject when preforming the activity.

Standard Deviation of Body Acceleration, Y Axis - The mean of the tBodyAcc-std()-Y observations for the subject when preforming the activity.

Standard Deviation of Body Acceleration, Z Axis - The mean of the tBodyAcc-std()-Z observations for the subject when preforming the activity.
